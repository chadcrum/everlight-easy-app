# Project Context Memory

## Current State
- **Branch**: master - main development branch for Everlight control app
- **Files**: Complete Next.js cyberpunk light controller with 6 modified components, API routes, and TypeScript interfaces
- **Last Commits**: Refactored from separate backend/frontend to unified Next.js app with cyberpunk styling and auto-apply functionality

## Active Work
- **Task**: Fixed data structure mismatch - API response now includes proper `alias` and `groups` fields, removed Apply button for direct click-to-activate
- **Progress**: Complete cyberpunk UI transformation, auto-apply functionality working, data handling fixed for real API response format
- **Key Decisions**: Made `alias`/`groups` optional in TypeScript, added fallback logic for missing fields, direct pattern activation on click

## Next Steps
- **Immediate**: Test with live hardware controller at 192.168.1.47 - sequences should now display with proper names and groups
- **Blockers**: None - all functionality complete and building successfully
- **Dependencies**: Everlight hardware controller API at configurable IP address (currently 192.168.1.47)

## Technical Notes
- App now handles both old format (single object) and new format (array with full metadata)
- Cyberpunk theme complete with neon effects, glitch animations, and holographic interfaces
- Auto-apply removes need for separate execute button - immediate light activation on selection
